/**
 * Base page setup.
 *
 * 1. Force scrollbars to always be visible to prevent awkward ‘jumps’ when
 *    navigating between pages that do/do not have enough content to produce
 *    scrollbars naturally.
 * 2. Ensure the page always fills at least the entire height of the viewport.
 * 3. Hide overflowing elements on mobile/narrow devices.
