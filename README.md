## Installation

1. Run `npm install`
2. Run `gulp`. There's only one task which compiles the Sass and watches for changes

## Stylelint

A Stylelint dotfile is included to enforce the coding style of the CSS and Sass. Also consider installing `SublimeLinter` and `SublimeLinter-contrib-stylelint` to get notifications in your text editor.
